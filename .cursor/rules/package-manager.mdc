# Package Manager Rule

This project uses Yarn as its package manager. Always use yarn commands instead of npm or pnpm.

## Examples of correct commands:
- `yarn add <package>` - to install a new package
- `yarn remove <package>` - to remove a package
- `yarn` - to install all dependencies
- `yarn dev` - to start the development server
- `yarn build` - to build the project

## Why Yarn?
- The project uses `yarn.lock` for dependency version locking
- Consistent with the project's existing setup
- Better performance and reliability for this specific project setup

## Important Notes:
- Never use `npm install` or `pnpm install`
- Always commit the `yarn.lock` file
- Use `yarn` commands in scripts and documentation
